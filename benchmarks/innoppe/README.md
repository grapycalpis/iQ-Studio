# InnoPPE Benchmark between Jetson AGX and Qualcomm QCS9075

We conducted a performance comparison between the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and
the [Qualcomm QCS9075](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/hardware/qualcomm-iq-9075-evaluation-kit-evk) by running the same application on both platforms,
focusing on their ability to handle multiple **video streams** and **YOLO model
inference**.

> Note: Testing for EXMP-Q911 will be included in future updates.

- How was the test conducted?

  - We used [InnoPPE][InnoPPE] as the main application for evaluation. 
      - innoPPE is a multi-channel safety monitoring system that can run across different streams simultaneously to monitor multiple locations in real time.

         <br />   

  - InnoPPE was configured to process 10 video streams simultaneous(1 live UVC
  camera and 9 locally stored video files).

  - Multiple AI inference were executed concurrently to perform simultaneous
  recognition tasks.

## Benchmark results

![benchmark_results](./fig/results.svg)

We compared several performance metrics between the IQ-9075-EVK and AIB-MX13-1-A1 while
running 10 InnoPPE channels, measuring FPS on the channel with a UVC camera
input, and observed that the FPS on the IQ-9075-EVK was approximately three times
higher than on the AIB-MX13-1-A1.

## Conclusion

Under the 10 channel(single UVC Cam, 9 Videos), the **IQ-9075-EVK** achieves per-channel performance (FPS) is 212.5% higher than the **AIB-MX13-1-A1**.


# Appendix: How do I execute the benchmark?

## What do you need?

1. Three python
   [scripts](./scripts): `system_monitor.py`, `draw_csv.py` and `print_mean.py`

2. `requirements.txt` for creating python virtual environment.

### Start the benchmark

1. Run `system_monitor.py` to start monitoring system metrics.

   ```bash
   python3 system_monitor.py
   ```

   The data will be continuously written to `test.csv`. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop monitoring.

2. After obtaining `test.csv`, run `draw_csv.py` to generate charts.

   ```bash
   python3 draw_csv.py
   ```

   The resulting charts will be saved in the `report/` directory.

   />

3. To calculate the average values of the collected metrics, run `print_mean.py`.

   ```bash
   python3 print_mean.py
   ```

   ```
   CPU Usage Average: 41.32%
   CPU Temperature Average: 43.74°C
   Memory Usage Average: 27.53%
   Disk Usage Average: 94.96%
   Network Usage Average: 0.02 MB/s
   ```
