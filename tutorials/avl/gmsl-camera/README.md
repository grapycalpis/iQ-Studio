# GMSL Camera

GMSL provides a highly flexible interface for camera installation. 

Unlike MIPI CSI-2, which typically supports only short-range connections of several tens of centimeters, GMSL enables long-distance video transmission up to 10 -15 meters over a single coaxial cable. This allows cameras to be placed several meters away from the platform while maintaining low latency and high reliability.

GMSL is widely used in autonomous driving, industrial mobile equipment, 360° surround-view stitching, and multi-channel real-time AI recognition applications.

> 💡 **Tip:** You check out the **[iQS-Streampipe](../../../applications/iqs-streampipe/README.md)** to see the how to run the multi-stream on our platform.

Connect the GMSL Camera to EXMP-Q911 and EB022-2M4F GMSL adapter board, follow the steps below:

1. Use a 22-pin to 22-pin MIPI cable (A-B style). Connect CN_CSIx to the corresponding FPC1 header. The cable type is required for proper CSI lane alignment.
2. Use Link A to connect the GMSL camera. Only Link A is supported, and the adapter board can operate with one MIPI sensor at a time.
3. Power on the EB022-2M4F first, and then power on the EXMP-Q911.

## How to Install the Driver for GMSL Camera

1. Copy the `.ipk`  or `.deb` to the target platform
    
    ```bash
    $ scp release/ev2m_oom3.ipk <target> # or ev2m_oom3.deb
    ```
    
2. Install and reboot
    - Yocto Linux 1.5
        1. Install `.ipk`
            
            ```
            $ mount -o rw,remount /usr
            $ opkg --nodeps install ./ev2m_oom3.ipk --force-reinstall

## How to Open the GMSL Camera

If the camera is properly connected to the platform and the required drivers are correctly installed, you can use the following GStreamer command to run the camera.

1. If you don’t have the file `/var/cache/camera/camxoverridesettings.txt`, please create one and add the following line inside it:
    
    ```bash
    HMSMaxDelayedJobCount=8
    ```
2. Run the following command
    ```bash
        $ gst-launch-1.0 -e qtiqmmfsrc name=camsrc camera=0 ! \
        'video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=30/1' ! \
        videoconvert ! v4l2h264enc !  h264parse ! mp4mux ! filesink location=test.mp4
    ```
